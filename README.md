1. I have a concern regarding the cache as whenever i close the browser or the opened tab and opens it again
   it will automatic adds the previously selected item inside the bag
   (we can discuss it on the next stage if it is expected behaviour or not)

2.In Order summary page i found an unusual behaviour
    a. The item price and subtotal price is differnt
    b. Unsual shipping price is coming something like this(From Â£9,007,199,254,740,991.00)
    c. Order summary total is showing the shipping price but not adding into the total amount.

    In email i have attached screenshots for proof
